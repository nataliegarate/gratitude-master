# Gratitude Master

Gratitude Master is an online journal space that encourages users to track what makes them happy. Logged-in users can create, read, update, and delete their entries which are stored in the PostgreSQL database.

## Start

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.
